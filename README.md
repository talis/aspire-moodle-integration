# Talis Reading List integrations with Moodle

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/talis/aspire-moodle-integration.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/talis/aspire-moodle-integration)

This repository contains two integrations between Moodle and Talis Aspire. A description of each follows to help you choose the right one for you.

There are individual README files for each plugin which contain installation and other useful instructions.

## Moodle 3.x mod_aspirelists

The activity module has been tested with all current versions of Moodle. [See the full matrix of versions tested](https://travis-ci.org/talis/aspire-moodle-integration).

This is an activity module which is essentially a wrapper for our [Talis Reading List LTI Tool](http://knowledge.talis.com/articles/tarl-lti/).

Users will be able to select and embed lists (or sections of lists) in their moodle courses. Lists and sections can be either displayed in-line or can be shown in embedded pages within Moodle.

This module is being actively maintained by Talis and the wider Talis Developer Community, and you are welcome to submit your own issues and pull requests!
